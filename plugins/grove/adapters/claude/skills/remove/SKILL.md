# Grove remove adapter

This is a read-through entrypoint, not a lifecycle authority. Resolve the
active installed Grove plugin root as the directory four levels above this file, then run:

```text
node <grove-plugin-root>/runtime/lifecycle/bin/grove-operation.mjs describe remove
```

Follow that emitted contract exactly. Do not infer, recreate, or extend remove
semantics from this adapter.
